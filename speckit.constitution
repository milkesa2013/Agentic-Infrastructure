# Project Chimera Constitution

## Preamble
This constitution establishes the foundational principles and governance framework for Project Chimera. All agents, contributors, and automated systems operating within this project must adhere to these principles without exception.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development is Law
- **Principle**: No code shall be written, modified, or deployed without a corresponding specification.
- **Enforcement**: 
  - All code changes must reference a documented spec in [`specs/`](specs/) before implementation.
  - Pull requests without linked specs shall be rejected by automated gatekeepers.
  - Specifications must precede implementation by at least one iteration.
- **Rationale**: Ensures intentionality, traceability, and alignment with project goals.

### 2. Safety First
- **Principle**: All live posts and production deployments must pass safety verification.
- **Gate Requirements**:
  - **Symbolic Guardian**: Automated validation of content against safety policies and patterns.
  - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Mandatory review by authorized human operators before any production release.
- **Exceptions**: None. Safety gates are non-negotiable for all live content.
- **Rationale**: Protects against unintended harm, reputational damage, and system compromise.

### 3. Agentic Traceability
- **Principle**: All AI-generated code must explicitly explain its alignment with project specifications.
- **Requirements**:
  - AI-generated artifacts must include traceable references to [`specs/technical.md`](specs/technical.md).
  - Every code contribution must document which specification it satisfies.
  - Alignment explanations must be reviewable and auditable.
- **Rationale**: Ensures AI outputs are intentional, verifiable, and aligned with project architecture.

### 4. Standardized Communication
- **Principle**: All agents must communicate using MCP (Model Context Protocol) primitives and standardized I/O contracts.
- **Requirements**:
  - Inter-agent communication must conform to defined MCP schemas.
  - I/O contracts must be versioned and documented.
  - Agents must reject non-conforming inputs and produce conformant outputs.
- **Rationale**: Guarantees interoperability, reduces ambiguity, and enables reliable agent orchestration.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require:
1. Proposed changes documented in a spec.
2. Review by authorized governance agents.
3. Unanimous approval from all core stakeholders.
4. Propagation to all agent configurations.

### Interpretation
- This constitution takes precedence over all other project documentation.
- Conflicts between this constitution and any other document shall be resolved in favor of this constitution.
- Questions of interpretation shall be escalated to human governance.

## Effective Date
This constitution is effective upon creation and applies retroactively to all project artifacts.
